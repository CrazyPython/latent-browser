# web4

A browser for web content generated by GPT-3.

this project is free but experimental, you will have to configure your own API credentials to access OpenAI (for GTP-3 / text-davinci-003) and Replicate (for stable diffusion).

## Quick start

### Initial setup

```bash
cd web4
yarn
cp .env.sample .env.local
```

Then open `.env.local` and add your OpenAI token + Replicate token

### Start the proxy in one tab

```bash
yarn proxy
```

### Start the browser in another tab

```bash
yarn tauri:dev
```

### Using the browser

- type something in it eg "a shop that sell golden eggs"
- click on "explore"
- wait about 20~40 seconds (sorry there is no loader yet)

## FAQ
