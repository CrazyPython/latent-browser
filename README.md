# web4

A browser for web content generated by GPT-3.

this project is free but experimental, you will have to configure your own API credentials to access OpenAI (for GTP-3 / text-davinci-003) and Replicate (for stable diffusion).

## Quick start

### Initial setup

```bash
cd web4
yarn
cp .env.sample .env.local
```

Then open `.env.local` and add your OpenAI token + Replicate token

### Start the proxy in one tab

yarn proxy
```

### Start the browser in another tab

```

## Using the browser

Here are some examples to get you started:

- `a clone of asteroid using <canvas>, the mouse should orient the spaceship, it should fire bullets when clicking, and bullets can destroy asteroids.`
- `website for a company selling time travel visit packages (great pyramids, Trojan wars..). The website features 3 polaroid pictures taken by tourists of those eras`
