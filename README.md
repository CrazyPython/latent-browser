# web4

A browser for web content generated by GPT-3.

this project is free but experimental, you will have to configure your own API credentials to access OpenAI (for GTP-3 / text-davinci-003, and dall-e 2).

Currently Replicate (stable diffusion) is disabled, as I had some latency issues with it (may I will put it back in the future!)

## Quick start

### Initial setup

```bash
cd web4
yarn
cp .env.sample .env.local
```

Then open `.env.local` and add your OpenAI token

### Start the browser in another tab

```bash
yarn tauri:dev
```

## Using the browser

Here are some examples to get you started:

- `a simulation of calculating PI by generating random dots inside a circle. The simulator should include a slider to adjust the speed, a reset button, and the current estimate of PI.`
- `a simple app to compute your BMI, using form inputs for age, height and weight (in kilos)`
- `a whack-a-mole game but with spiders, a css 3-per-3 grid, emojis, and JS code`
- `a clone of asteroid using <canvas>, the mouse should orient the spaceship, it should fire bullets when clicking, and bullets can destroy asteroids.`
- `website for a company selling time travel visit packages (great pyramids, Trojan wars..). The website features 3 polaroid pictures taken by tourists of those eras`

## FAQ
