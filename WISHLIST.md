# Feature wishlist

- Fix the HTML export button
- Have a better display for the prompt + code history (in the local storage or file storage)
- Support OpenAI connect (there was a tweet about them working on some kind of oauth SSO)
- Button to share to Vercal or similar
- Generate APIs, not just UIs
- A shared catalog of apps (I'm not gonna say "marketplace" since there are no plans for monetization)
- Community apps: a flagging/verification system for the "featured" apps
- Save the prompt to a private (but sharable) storage on IPFS (https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db)
- Add support for the ai:// protocol to share a link or open links (note: we might have to ditch tauri unless they implement this https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/323)
